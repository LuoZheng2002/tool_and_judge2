But wait, the function also has an optional parameter for sales_units_increase_percentage. \n\nWait, the user wants to increase the sales units by 10%, so I need to get the current sales units and the current price.

Maybe the function internally uses the current sales data. \n\nWait, the function's description says it multiplies sales units of the product with its selling price. So maybe the sales units here refer to the current sales units, and the increase percentage is applied on top of that. But the function's parameters don't include current sales units.

To calculate that, we need the current sales units and the current price. But the functions provided don't have a way to get the current sales units. The corporate_finance_product_price function can get the current price, but not the sales units. So maybe the user needs to first get the current price using the product_price function, and then use the revenue_forecast function with the sales increase. But the revenue_forecast function requires the company and product, and the sales_units_increase_percentage. However, without knowing the current sales units, how can we calculate the new revenue? \n\nWait, maybe the revenue_forecast function assumes that the current sales units are known and applies the increase. But the parameters don't include current sales units. This is confusing. The user's question requires knowing the current sales units and price. Since the functions don't provide a way to get sales units, maybe the answer is that the functions are insufficient. But the user might expect that the revenue_forecast function can be used with the given parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sales_units_increase_percentage is the only parameter needed, but that doesn't make sense. The function's required parameters are company and product, and the sales_units_increase_percentage is optional. So, to use the revenue_forecast function, we need to provide company (XYZ), product (Product A), and the sales_units_increase_percentage (10).

Unless the function uses some internal data. \n\nWait, maybe the function is designed to take the current sales units as part of its data, and the user is supposed to provide the increase percentage. But the user hasn't provided the current sales units. Therefore, the answer would be that the required parameters are missing. However, the user might have intended to use the revenue_forecast function with the given increase percentage. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is supposed to first get the current price using the product_price function, then use that price in the revenue_forecast function. But the revenue_forecast function doesn't take the price as a parameter. It multiplies sales units by the selling price, which would be obtained from the product_price function. But the functions are separate. \n\nSo, the steps would be: \n1. Get the current price of Product A from company XYZ using corporate_finance_product_price.\n2. Use corporate_finance_revenue_forecast with company XYZ, product A, and sales_units_increase_percentage of 10. \n\nBut the revenue_forecast function doesn't take the price as a parameter. It must be that the function internally uses the current sales units and price. However, without knowing the current sales units, we can't compute the revenue. Therefore, the functions provided are insufficient. \n\nBut the user might have intended that the revenue_forecast function can be called with the increase percentage, assuming that the current sales units are known. So, the answer would be to call the revenue_forecast function with company XYZ, product A, and sales_units_increase_percentage of 10. \n\nBut the user's question is about the revenue after increasing sales units by 10%, so the function should calculate the new revenue based on the current sales units and price. However, since the functions don't provide a way to get the current sales units or price, maybe the answer is that the required parameters are missing. \n\nWait, the user hasn't provided the current sales units or price. So, the functions can't be used without that information. Therefore, the answer is that the required parameters are missing. But the user might have expected that the functions can be used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the revenue_forecast function uses the current sales units and price from some internal data, and the user just needs to provide the increase percentage. In that case, the function call would be to corporate_finance_revenue_forecast with company XYZ, product A, and sales_units_increase_percentage 10. \n\nBut the user's question is about the revenue after the increase, which requires knowing the current sales units and price.

The formula is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. Since they're asking for AA, which is homozygous dominant, that should be p squared. So if p is 0.3, then AA frequency is 0.3 squared. Let me check the tools provided. There's a function called calculate_genotype_frequency that takes allele_frequency and genotype as parameters. The genotype can be AA, Aa, or aa. The user specified AA, so I need to call that function with allele_frequency 0.3 and genotype \"AA\". The other functions like math_factorial and find_flute don't seem relevant here. So the correct tool call should be calculate_genotype_frequency with those parameters.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"calculate_genotype_frequency\", \"arguments\": {\"allele_frequency\": 0.3, \"genotype\": \"AA\"}}\n</tool_call>"}}}}

The user wants to calculate the balance of a mutual fund. They provided the investment amount as $50,000, an annual yield of 5%, and a time period of 3 years.\n\nFirst, I need to check which function to use. The available functions are calculate_mutual_fund_balance and geometry_calculate_area_circle. The question is about a mutual fund, so the calculate_mutual_fund_balance function is the right choice.\n\nLooking at the parameters required for that function: investment_amount (integer), annual_yield (number), and years (integer). The user provided all three: $50,000, 5%, and 3 years. The annual yield is a percentage, but the function expects a number, which could be a decimal. So 5% should be converted to 0.05. However, the function's parameter is a number, so maybe it's okay as 5 or 0.05. Wait, the description says annual yield rate, so typically that's a decimal like 0.05 for 5%. But the example might accept 5 as a percentage. Wait, the function's annual_yield is a number, so maybe it's expecting 5, not 0.05. But I need to check. However, the user input is 5%, which is 5 as a percentage. So maybe the function expects 5. But I should follow the user's input as given. The user wrote 5%, so perhaps the function expects 5. But sometimes, functions might require the decimal form. Hmm. Wait, the function's parameters don't specify, but the description says annual yield rate, which is typically a decimal. However, the user might have input 5% as 5. So maybe the function expects 5. But I need to make sure. However, since the function's parameter is a number, both 5 and 0.05 are valid, but the correct way is 0.05. Wait, but maybe the function is designed to take the percentage as a whole number, like 5 for 5%, and then internally converts it. But without more info, I should use the value as provided. The user wrote 5%, so the annual_yield should be 5. But I need to check the function's parameters again. The function's annual_yield is a number, so it's okay. So the parameters would be investment_amount: 50000, annual_yield: 5, years: 3. Wait, but if the function expects the yield as a decimal, then 5% would be 0.05. But the user might have input 5% as 5. So maybe the function is designed to take the percentage as a whole number. However, the function's description says \"annual yield rate\", which is typically a decimal. But the user's input is 5%, so perhaps the function expects 5. But this is ambiguous. However, since the function's parameter is a number, and the user provided 5%, I'll assume that the function expects 5 as the value. Alternatively, maybe the function expects 0.05. But without more info, I'll proceed with the user's input as 5. So the function call would be calculate_mutual_fund_balance with investment_amount 50000, annual_yield 5, years 3. Wait, but maybe the function requires the yield as a decimal. For example, 5% is 0.05. But the user wrote 5%, so maybe the function expects 5. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. If the function is designed to take the annual yield rate as a percentage (like 5 for 5%), then the calculation would be correct. If it's a decimal, then 0.05. But since the function's parameter is a number, both are acceptable. However, the user's input is 5%, so I'll use 5 as the value. Therefore, the correct function call is to calculate_mutual_fund_balance with investment_amount 50000, annual_yield 5, years 3.\n</think>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"calculate_mutual_fund_balance\", \"arguments\": {\"investment_amount\": 50000, \"annual_yield\": 5, \"years\": 3}}\n</tool_call>"}}}}
